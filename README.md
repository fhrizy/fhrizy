- 👋 Hi, I’m @fhrizy
- 👀 I'm an experienced MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) developer with two years in web development. Recently, I added Ionic React to my skills, diving into cross-platform mobile app development. From building dynamic interfaces with React.js to managing data with MongoDB, my MERN expertise is solid. I also use Tailwind CSS for efficient styling, ensuring clean and modern designs.
I've embraced Next.js to boost web app performance, incorporating React components on the server side for faster loading and better user experiences. I'm excited about applying my diverse skills to innovative projects, delivering user-friendly solutions that blend MERN, Ionic React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on you guys.
